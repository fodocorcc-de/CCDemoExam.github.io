## Introduction

The "Open Exam Application - Cybernetic Edition" is a standalone, offline-capable exam system with a futuristic cybernetic UI theme. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a highly flexible platform for creating and taking multiple-choice exams. It features timed tests, advanced user-driven exam configuration, immediate detailed results with performance analytics, and auto-redirect to dashboard upon completion.

## Features

*   **Single File Portability:** The entire application runs from a single `exam.html` file, making it highly portable and suitable for offline use on any modern web browser.
*   **Custom Exam Banks (JSON):**
    *   Load external exam question banks from a local JSON file.
    *   Load exam banks from a publicly accessible URL hosting a JSON file.
    *   Supports a defined [JSON schema](./bank/README.md) for creating custom exams, including domain-specific questions, answer explanations, and configurable exam parameters.
*   **Advanced Exam Setup:**
    *   **Default Settings Mode:** Uses the settings from the JSON file. It uses a highly accurate **proportional distribution algorithm (Largest Remainder Method)** to follow the `DomainPercentages`.
    *   **Quick Start Mode:** Allows users to start an exam quickly with a specific number of questions chosen randomly from the entire question bank.
    *   **Custom Selection Mode:** Empowers users to build their own exam by:
        *   Selecting one or more specific topics (Domains of Knowledge).
        *   Choosing the number of questions to be drawn randomly *only from the selected topics*.
*   **Modern Exam Experience:**
    *   Clean, **responsive user interface** that works on both **desktop and mobile devices**.
    *   Optional, user-configurable timer with automatic submission when time expires.
    *   Navigation (Next/Back buttons), with an option in the JSON (`"BackNavigation": false`) to disable the "Back" button.
    *   Progress bar indicating the user's current position in the exam.
*   **Performance Analytics:**
    *   **Confidence Score:** A unique metric that scores your performance based on both the correctness of your answer and the time taken to respond. Faster, correct answers yield a higher score.
    *   **Time Warnings:** An optional feature that provides a visual indicator during the exam if you are spending longer than the average time on a single question.
*   **Immediate Results & Enhanced Review:**
    *   Instant scoring upon submission, including correct, incorrect, and **unanswered** counts, overall percentage, and the new Confidence Score.
    *   Results are broken down by knowledge domain and **sorted by performance** (best to worst) to provide clear insights.
    *   Option to review **correct, incorrect, and unanswered** questions.
    *   The review screen now includes icons to flag specific questions:
        *   A **clock icon (üï∞Ô∏è)** appears next to any answered question where the time taken was significantly above average.
        *   An **'x' icon (‚ùå)** appears next to any question that was left unanswered.
*   **Developer Debug Mode:**
    *   A `DEBUG` flag is available in the script to output detailed logs to the developer console.
*   **Demo Mode:** Includes a built-in demo exam for quick testing and demonstration of all features.
